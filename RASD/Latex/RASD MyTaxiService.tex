\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
This document is intended to help understand and communication of the requirements of the system, explaining both the application domain and the system that you want to accomplish. It explains the functional features of the MyTaxiService, along with interface details, design constraints and related considerations such as performance characteristics. It can be considered as a contract between the developer and the customer. 
It is the basis for the planning of the project and to estimate its duration and its cost. It is the base for the activities of testing, verification and validation. The RASD should in fact contain sufficient information to verify if the final system actually satisfies the requirements contained in the document itself. This document follows the IEEE standard for software requirements specification documents. 
\subsection{Intended audience}
This document is intended for all individuals participating in and/or supervising the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item Expected audience of this document is the developers and anyone who intends to develop on this program
\item Developers who can review project's capabilities and more easily understand where their efforts should be targeted to improve or add more features to it (it sets the guidelines for future development). 
\item Project testers can use this document as a base for their testing strategy as some bugs are easier to find using a requirements document. This way testing becomes more methodically organized.
\item End users of this application who wish to read about what this project can do.
\end{itemize}
\section{Scope}
The main accent is to simplify and optimize the access of passengers to the system and to guarantee fair management of taxi queues. We will build flexible and user-friendly web application and a mobile application that will run on Android and IOS mobile phones. This application can be used by anyone who previously will be register on the registration page. After the registration is done the user will have a user name and password that should remember for furthermore usage of the system. The passenger can call a taxi after a successful logging on the application. After that he can call a taxi and he will be informed about the code of the incoming taxi, waiting time. On the other hand taxi drivers will have a mobile application where the major purpose will be to inform the system about their availability, confirmation of a certain call and global map navigation.  City is divided into taxi zones that are uniquely associated with corresponding taxi queues for efficient usage of the system. 
\section{Goals}
We think that the system has to provide this features:
\newline
[G1] Only registered users can use the service - high priority
\newline
[G2] Registered users can use service if and only if they are logged in - high priority 
\newline
[G3] Only eligible users approved by administration can become taxi drivers - high priority 
\newline
[G4] Users can request taxi - high priority 
\newline
[G5] Users can reserve taxi - high priority 
\newline
[G6] Users can cancel a ride - high priority 
\newline
[G7] Checking taxi availability - high priority 
\newline
[G9] Confirming/declining a ride (taxi driver) - high priority 
\newline
[G10] Taxi driver's availability can be changed - high priority 
\section{Abbreviations}
\begin{itemize}
\item ETA: Estimated Time of Arrival, approximated time of arrival of taxi vehicle to destination

\end{itemize}
\section{Document overview}
This document is divided in four parts with clean and non-ambiguity description of the whole system.
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter 1: General description and basic informartion of the system
\item Chapter 2: Explanation of the main functionalities with constraints, assumptions and hardware dependencies.
\item Chapter 3: Specifications of the system functionalities and non-system functionalities possible scenarios
\item Chapter 4: Use cases and UML models

\end{itemize}
\chapter{Overall description}
\section{Product perspective}
MyTaxiService is a mobile application (Android and iOS) and web application that require users to have access to a web browser on their smartphone or personal computer. The concept is based on the idea of establishing a direct connection between drivers and passengers to offer both sides a modern alternative to conventional booking processes.  After research on the market we will provide unique system for booking a taxi that will benefit customers with cheap fast and satisfying usage of the system.
\section{The world and the machine}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{worldmachine.jpg}%
\end{figure}
The world - these activities are initiated by the user or driver or by their environment
\begin{itemize}
\item Taxi movement - happens in user environment
\item Payment - happens between user and driver without accessing the application
\item Accident - can be caused by another vehicles in traffic user environment
\item User behavior - can change the actual state
\end{itemize}
The machine - these activities are used in the system, transparent to users
\begin{itemize}
\item Sending notifications - those actions are initiated by the system, does not include user actions
\item ETA algorithm - is performed by the system
\item Taxi queue and schedule algorithm - is used to efficiently find available taxi vehicle from queue of user's current zone
\item Database - is located in the server side where all datas are stored
\end{itemize}
Shared - these activities require both user and system actions to be completed
\begin{itemize}
\item Request taxi - first, user has to specify origin of the ride and send to system , then system needs to find available taxi driver to complete request
\item Reserve taxi - user has to specify meeting time, origin and destination of the ride, then the system needs to find a taxi vehicle. After that, reservation is completed.
\item Register user/driver - requires user to fill the form that will be sent to the system, which creates user's profile and send back the confirmation message.
\item Confirm decline request - involves user and system. System sends proposal of the ride and then user can choose whether to confirm or decline a ride
\end{itemize}
\section{Product functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Registration: } a guest user can register as passenger:
the user will be able to insert his information such as: first name, last name, e-Mail, phone number, credit card and date of birth.
\\
\item \textbf{Request Taxi: } after the request, the system will report the amount of the trip to the passenger and he can proceed with the payment. After that according to the informations provided by the passenger, the system will have to alert the closest driver in the queue of the desired zone.
\\
\item \textbf{Reserve taxi: }passengers can reserve a taxi at least 2 hours before the desired time. After the reservation, a taxi will be allocates to the request 10 minutes before the meeting time. 
\end{itemize}
\section{User characteristic}
We expect massive usage from people who use public transport on a daily basis regardless age, gender and nationality. Expected users must have basic knowledge of using web browser and have access to internet.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Guest: }a person that has not registered and can only exploit basic functionalities such as looking for help. 
\item \textbf{User: }a person that has registered and has provided his personal information and a set of abilities. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Passenger
\item Taxi driver
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Administrator: }the responsible for the web application. The only one that can accept new abilities from users. 
\end{itemize}
\section{Constraints}
Mayor constrains are related to security and reliability of the system and customers. The Service may admit you to link to other websites, services or resources on the Internet, and other websites, services or resources may contain links to the Site. When you access third party websites, you do so at your own risk. These other websites are not under our control.
