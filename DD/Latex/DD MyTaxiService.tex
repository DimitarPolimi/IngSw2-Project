\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
This document describes the system architecture and design of MyTaxiService system. Each component is described in terms of its external interfaces and the dependencies on other components. It will form the basis of the planning of the development phase and will be updated using the results from the various development iterations to come to complete architectural design.  The architecture review will allow us to identify what are the weaknesses or strengths of the proposed architecture as well as we hope to obtain a list of suggested changes to improve it. It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.
\section{Scope}
This document applies to the overall design of the system. It contains information relating to the architectural design of the software, the Structure of the Database, and of the physical servers hosting the site.
The main accent is to simplify and optimize the access of passengers to the system and to guarantee fair management of taxi queues. We will build flexible and user-friendly web application and a mobile application that will run on Android and IOS mobile phones. This application can be used by anyone who previously will be register on the registration page. After the registration is done the user will have a user name and password that should remember for furthermore usage of the system. The passenger can call a taxi after a successful logging on the application. After that he can call a taxi and he will be informed about the code of the incoming taxi, waiting time. On the other hand taxi drivers will have a mobile application where the major purpose will be to inform the system about their availability, confirmation of a certain call and global map navigation.  City is divided into taxi zones that are uniquely associated with corresponding taxi queues for efficient usage of the system. 
\section{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Request}: Passenger filled form for immediate ride
\item \textbf{Reservation}: Passengers can request for a vehicle at least 2 hours before the ride and can reserve his ride
\item \textbf{User}: Is a customer who already registered and logged into the system
\item \textbf{Taxi driver}: Is a person who legally drives taxi ( with driver license and work license) already registered and logged into the system as a driver
\item \textbf{System}: Is the system that has to be designed
\item \textbf{Taxi zone}: Are the zones in which the city is divided in

\section{Component interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RegisteredUsers: }is a module where clients who already sign up can access their account and can use the features of the application. This component contains sign in module for authentication the users and its communicating with \textbf{RegisteredManager}.
\item \textbf{LicensedTaxiDrivers: }is a module where licensed taxi drivers access their account and can use the features of the application. This component contains sign in module for authentication the users and its communicating with \textbf{LicensedTaxiDriversManager}.
\item \textbf{UnregisteredUsers: }is a module where guest who don't have an account can sign up for using the features of the application. If the guest click on the sign up button it will be redirected to the sign up form for entering basic information. 
\item \textbf{RegisteredManager: } this module is connected with registered users who already sign up and have their own account. It managing all registered users showing them the home page, notifying the users and etc. and is communicating with \textbf{DataLayer} for storing, deleting or retrieval information that is needed.  
\item \textbf{LicensedTaxiDriversManager: }is managing licensed taxi drivers who are already sign up and have their own account. It is communicating with the taxi drivers notifying them about taxi requests, reservations and their cancelation. It can send and receive notification from the taxi drivers, update information about their availability and accept or declined requests. Also it?s communicating with \textbf{DataLayer} for storing, deleting or retrieval information that is needed. 
\item \textbf{UnregisteredUsersManager: }this module is managing the whole registration process for the guests who don't have an account. It is communicating with DataLayer for notifying the system for a new profile and to store the data in the database system. 
\item \textbf{DataLayer }module is managing the whole data of the system. This module is encrypted and can create, delete, modify, store and update informations when it is required.
\item \textbf{Scheduler }module is managing the informations that is needed for the taxi drivers and users. 
\item \textbf{DetermineTaxiZone }module is determine the zone for the taxies so when the user request taxi 
this module is response for calling the taxi nearest to the customer. Also is taking care to have availably taxis in every zone.
\item \textbf{QueuesManager: }this module is providing functions to manage all the taxis queues of the city. It communicate with \textbf{LicensedTaxiDriversManager} in order to retrieve information about taxi?s availability and eventually move it to the end of the queue.

\section{Selected architectural styles and patterns}
\begin{figure}[h]
\center \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{componentinterface}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{N-Tier} data applications are data applications that are separated into multiple tiers. Also called "distributed applications" and "multitier applications," 
n-tier applications separate processing into discrete tiers that are distributed between the client and the server.A typical n-tier application includes a presentation tier, a middle tier, and a data tier
In addition to the advantages of distributing programming and data throughout a network, n-tier applications have the advantages that any one tier can run on an appropriate processor or operating system platform and can be updated independently of the other tiers.

\item \textbf{Database (Data) Tier} - At this tier, the database resides along with its query processing languages. We also have the relations that define the data and their constraints at this level.

\item \textbf{Application (Middle) Tier} - At this tier reside the application server and the programs that access the database. For a user, this application tier presents an abstracted view of the database. End-users are unaware of any existence of the database beyond the application. At the other end, the database tier is not aware of any other user beyond the application tier. Hence, the application layer sits in the middle and acts as a mediator between the end-user and the database.

\item \textbf{User (Presentation) Tier} - End-users operate on this tier and they know nothing about any existence of the database beyond this layer. At this layer, multiple views of the database can be provided by the application. All views are generated by applications that reside in the application tier.

\item \textbf{Multiple-Tier} database architecture is highly modifiable, as almost all its components are independent and can be changed independently.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]
\center \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{archstyle}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
The model-view-controller pattern proposes three main components or objects to be used in software development:
\vspace{2cm}
\begin{figure}[h]
\center \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{mvc.png}
\end{figure}
\vspace{2cm}
\begin{description}
\item[]- \textbf{Model}, which represents the underlying, logical structure of data in a software application and the high-level class associated with it. This object model does not contain any information about the user interface.
\item[]- \textbf{View}, which is a collection of classes representing the elements in the user interface (all of the things the user can see and respond to on the screen, such as buttons, display boxes, and so forth)
\item[]- \textbf{Controller}, which represents the classes connecting the model and the view, and is used to communicate between classes in the model and view.
\end{description}
When the MVC and three-tier approaches are brought together the View and Controller are considered the presentation tier, the Model exists in the business tier (and has access to many business and data tier modules). To a certain extent the Model could span both the business and data tiers. Writes take considerably more data storage resources than do reads, so separating these into different physical data stores can have huge benefit. It should also identify that the modules for the business and data logic can be numerous. And these exist for maintainability and scalability purposes. It is also reasonable that the Model may access the Data Tier directly without going through a Business Tier module.
