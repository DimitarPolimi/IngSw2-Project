\chapter{Functional Points Approach}
\section{Introduction}
Frequently the term end user or user is used without specifying what is meant. In this case, the user is a sophisticated user. Someone that would understand the system from a functional perspective --- more than likely someone that would provide requirements or does acceptance testing. 

Since Function Points measures systems from a functional perspective they are independent of technology. Regardless of language, development method, or hardware platform used, the number of function points for a system will remain constant. The only variable is the amount of effort needed to deliver a given set of function points; therefore, Function Point Analysis can be used to determine whether a tool, an environment, a language is more productive compared with others within an organization or among organizations. This is a critical point and one of the greatest values of Function Point Analysis.

An ILF is a user-identifiable group of logically related data or control information maintained within the boundary of the application. The primary intent of an ILF is to hold data maintained through one or more elementary processes of the application being counted."
Furthermore, for data or control information to be counted as an ILF, both of the following IFPUG counting rules must also apply:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The group of data or control information is logical and user identifiable.
\item The group of data is maintained through an elementary process within the application boundary being counted.
\end{enumerate}
An external interface file (EIF) is a user identifiable group of logically related data or control information referenced by the application, but maintained within the boundary of another application. The primary intent of an EIF is to hold data referenced through one or more elementary processes within the boundary of the application counted. This means an EIF counted for an application must be in an ILF in another application
\\ \\
An external input (EI) is an elementary process that processes data or control information that comes from outside the application boundary. The primary intent of an EI is to maintain one or more ILFs and/or to alter the behavior of the system.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{ei.png}
\end{figure}
\\ \\
An external output (EO) is an elementary process that sends data or control information outside the application boundary. The primary intent of an external output is to present information to a user through processing logic other than, or in addition to, the retrieval of data or control information . The processing logic must contain at least one mathematical formula or calculation, create derived data maintain one or more ILFs or alter the behavior of the system. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{eo.png}
\end{figure}
\\ \\
An external inquiry (EQ) is an elementary process that sends data or control information outside the application boundary. The primary intent of an external inquiry is to present information to a user through the retrieval of data or control information from an ILF of EIF. The processing logic contains no mathematical formulas or calculations, and creates no derived data. No ILF is maintained during the processing, nor is the behavior of the system altered.

\section{Function points calculation}
The following table outline the number of Functional Point based on functionality and relative complexity:
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c |c |c|c |}
\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Function Type} & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Complexity}\\  \cline{2-4}
&Simple & Medium&Complex\\ 
\hline
\hline
Internal Logic File & 7 & 10 & 15 \\
\hline
External Logic File & 5 & 7 & 10\\
\hline
External Input & 3 & 4 & 6\\
\hline
External Output & 4 & 5 & 7\\
\hline
External Inquiry & 3 & 4 & 6\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
We perform the calculation step by step:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Internal Logic Files (ILFs):} The application has ILFs, used to store and manage informations about users (Passenger or Taxi Driver), reservation, call and notification.
For notification, call and information about users we can use a simple weight for the not so difficult operation involved. Different case for the reservation that we adopt a complex weight.
\\
So we have: $3 \times 7 +  1 \times 15 = $\textbf{ 36 FPs}
\item \textbf{External Logic Files (ELFs):} The application use two ELFs. One to manage the GPS, using the GoogleMap APIs and the second is the phone company for manage the calls.
These are simple operation so in this case we have: $2 \times 5= $\textbf{ 10 FPs}
\item \textbf{External Input:} The application uses these following inputs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Login/Logout: simple operations so we have $2 \times 3= $\textbf{ 6 FPs}
\item Sign In: This is a simple operation too so $1 \times 3= $\textbf{ 3 FPs}
\item Create a taxi reservation: This is a complex operation because involved more than one entity, so $1 \times 6= $\textbf{ 6 FPs}
\item Change a taxi reservation: This is a complex operation because involved more than one entity, so $1 \times 6= $\textbf{ 6 FPs}
\item Delete a taxi reservation: This is a complex operation because involved more than one entity, so $1 \times 6= $\textbf{ 6 FPs}
\item Call a taxi: This is a simple operation, so $1 \times 3= $\textbf{ 3 FPs}
\item Insert taxi availability: This is a simple operation, so $1 \times 3= $\textbf{ 3 FPs}
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{External Output:} The application produces the following outputs: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Send a notification to the taxi driver for a desired reservation
\item Send a notification to the passenger to confirm the reservation
\item Call the taxi driver for a ride
\end{itemize}
The first two outputs can considers as medium weight, but the call we can consider is with a simple weight, so we have: $2 \times 5 + 1 \times 4= $\textbf{ 14 FPs}
\item \textbf{External Inquiry:} The application allows user to:
\begin{itemize}
\item View the available taxi for a reservation
\item Change the status of a taxi driver
\end{itemize}
The first can consider as a medium weight, the second as a simple weight.
$1 \times 4 + 1 \times 3= $\textbf{ 7 FPs}
\end{itemize}
In conclusion we have: $36 + 10 + 6 + 3 +6 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 +14 + 7 =$\textbf{100 FPs}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Precedentedness:} It reflects the teams previous experience with this kind of projects. Since for this team it was the first experience using this framework and these development methodologies, such as J2EE and Android, this value will be low.
\item \textbf{Development flexibility: }It reflects the degree of flexibility in the development process. The teachers and teaching assistants constructed the assignments giving the general specifications without going too much in details, making this project development very flexible, so, for this reason this value is going to be set to high - general conformity.
\item \textbf{Risk resolution: }Reflects the extent of risk analysis carried out. This value will be high, considering this project.
\item \textbf{Team cohesion: }Reflects how well the development team know each other and work together. Let?s assume that this is team's first project and that they didn't know each other previously. Also, let's assume that there are synchronization problems, such as different academic assignments during project for each of the members. So, this driver will be high - largely cooperative.
\item \textbf{Process maturity: }This was evaluated around the 18 Key Process Area (KPAs) in the SEI Capability Model. 
\newline \newline
There are five levels of process maturity, level 1 (lowest half) to level 5 (highest). The CMM specifies "what" should be in the software process rather than "when" or "for how long".
\newline \newline
The CMM level 1 is for organizations that don't focus on processes or documenting lessons learned. The CMM level 1 is for organizations that have implemented most of the requirements that would satisfy CMM level 2. In CMM's published definition, level 1 (lower half) and (Upper half) are grouped into level 1.

\section{COCOMO II calculation}
To pass from FP(Function Points) to SLOC(Source Lines of Code) we use an average conversion factor of 46 lines of code for each function point: \\
$$100 FPs * 46 = 4600 SLOC $$
\\
EAF: Effort Adjustment Factor derived from Cost Drivers. EAF=0.69\\
E:Exponent derived from Scale Drivers. E=0.91 + 0.01*Scale Drivers = 1.0613\\ \\
The formula to calculate the effort is the following:
$$effort = 2.94 * EAF * (KSLOC)^E$$
so we have\\
\centerline{$effort = 2.94 * (0.69) * (4600)^{1.0613} = 10.24$ Person-Months} \mbox{} \\
Now we try to calculate the schedule (duration) of project in month with the following formula\\
\centerline{$Duration = 3.67 * (effort)^{E-0.91}$} \mbox{} \\
we use a new value for E, that is 0.1513. So we have \\ \\
\centerline{$Duration = 3.67 *(10.24)^{0.1513} = 5.21$ Months} \mbox{} \\
\mbox{} \\
Now we can estimate the number of people needed to complete the project with
the following formula: \\ \\
\centerline{$N_{people} = effort / Duration$} \mbox{} \\
\centerline{$N_{people} = 10.24/5.21 = 1.96 \rightarrow 2$ people}
\section{Risk}
A risk is an event or condition that, if it occurs, could have a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives. Risk Management is the process of identifying, assessing, responding to, monitoring and controlling, and reporting risks. This Risk Management Plan defines how risks associated with the MyTaxiService project will be identified, analyzed, and managed. It outlines how risk management activities will be performed, recorded, and monitored throughout the lifecycle of the project and provides templates and practices for recording and prioritizing risks by the Risk Manager and/or Risk Management Team.
\\
\\
\textbf{\large{Risk Assessment}}
\\
\\
Risk assessment is the act of determining the probability that a risk will occur and the impact that event would have, should it occur. This is basically a "cause and effect" analysis. The "cause" is the event that might occur, while the "effect" is the potential impact to a project, should the event occur. Assessment of a risk involves two factors. First is the probability which is the measure of certainty that an event, or risk, will occur. This can be measured in a number of ways, but for the MyTaxiService project will be assigned a probability as defined in the table below.
\\
\begin{table}[h]
